      <h3>
        I am a Junior Software Developer, with expertise in both front/back-end
        interfaces – a thorough understanding of HTML & CSS, Javascript, React,
        SQL, and Node. Along with technical know-how, I have worked to hone an
        incredible set of skills, 6-years of proven team-building experience
        along over 4-years of end-to-end project management ability. This wide
        breadth of knowledge has allowed me to build countless customer
        relations and adaptability in any circumstance. I made a career change
        into the development world which fit my personality of being well
        organized, a team builder, and continued growth in my critical thinking.
        This time last year, the path became clear for me to pursue a job in
        coding, and in September 2019, I enrolled in Flatiron’s Software
        Engineering program. After dedicating 6 months prior to the program of
        pre-work and five months, including forty plus hours a week of immersing
        myself in learning numerous programming languages and tools, I consider
        myself a full-stack developer. I am equally comfortable developing and
        designing Front end and Back end Applications and also gained the skills
        of becoming a professional Googler. But the biggest skill I learned
        since joining the coding world is how to take a brand new tool or
        language and have it feel like an old friend. Before starting school at
        Flatiron to become a web developer, I worked in retail as a Visual Stock
        lead where I diligently worked to train and manage successful teams
        within each unit through a span of 6 years and built one-on-one customer
        service skills, where I learned customer engagement by maintaining
        customer relations. This is where I met a customer who was a developer
        and inspired me to take a chance and make a career shift to the
        developing world. I quickly became immersed in the mindset of a
        developer, from developing applications, focused attention to detail and
        accuracy, to interacting with other developers within pairing projects
        which have proven my level of communication and being a consistent
        collaborator. Gaining the one-on-one customer service and
        decision-making within retail, I soon came to realize that skills I had
        gained also helped me reach out to other developers whether it would be
        for networking events in person or even online webinars. I pictured
        myself as a developer, imagining a gratifying and stimulating job
        solving tough problems and building tools that make a lasting
        difference, and here I am.
